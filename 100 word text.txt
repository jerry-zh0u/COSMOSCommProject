The old, weathered lighthouse stood as a sentinel against the relentless sea. Its once pristine white exterior was now a patchwork of grays and greens, a testament to countless storms endured. Inside, the spiral staircase creaked with each step, a haunting melody echoing through the tower. From its lofty perch, the keeper watched over the endless expanse, a solitary figure against the horizon. The rhythmic crash of waves provided a constant, comforting companion in the quiet solitude.
